What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

      The overarching problem that I was solving this course was finding the best way to organize some courses in a catalog. I was given a list of courses and their prerequisites, and I made a program that would do different things with the given data.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

      I approcahed the problem from a few different angles. I learned about vectors, hashtables, trees, and how they organize data. In the end, a linked list was used to handle the data. These different structures are faster or slower than each other, and 
      have their advantages when handling data. That is why it is important to know them all, so you know which would be best for the certain scenario.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

      I had one major issue where my program I was using could not load any given data. This caused me a lot of trouble, but eventually I found using an entierly different program allowed it to work. It was much slower but it got the job done.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

      My work in this course showed me that there are different ways to approach something, and it is important to look at the pros and cons of each. By doing this you can determine the best possible option to continue the work with.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

      I definitely include more notes in my code than I did before. I found that doing so helps me know exactly what each part does better. This also helps someone else looking at my code see how it all works and what I did that made it work.
